#Professor Bingo - Ruby Web Application#

The general idea of the Professor Bingo project is as follows: an application consisting of a web service with a usable web front-end, as well as a mobile Android application will provide a sort of Bingo variant where instead of randomly drawing card locations from a mechanical ball blower, game board squares will be marked complete when professors demonstrate certain mannerisms during class. Students will connect either to the web interface or to the mobile app and enter a game session when their class begins. As time passes and their professor demonstrates his or her mannerisms, students will mark their game boards until one of them achieves a Bingo. This studentâ€™s account will be credited with a score for this win.
